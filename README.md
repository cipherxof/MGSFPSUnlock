# MGSFPSUnlock
This is an experimental mod that allows you to play Metal Gear Solid 3 at framerates above (and below) 60. This mod is a work in progress so you should expect there to be issues.

## How to use

1. Download `MGSFPSUnlock.zip` from the [releases](https://github.com/cipherxof/MGSFPSUnlock/releases) page
2. Extract to your MGS2/MGS3 install location (i.e `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\MGS3`)
3. Edit `MGSFPSUnlock.ini` and choose your target framerate.
4. Install [MGSHDFix](https://github.com/Lyall/MGSHDFix) and enable Borderless Windowed mode (this shouldn't be required in the future)

## Steam Deck/Linux Additional Instructions
ðŸš©**You do not need to do this if you are using Windows!**
- Open up the game properties of MGS2/MGS3 in Steam and add `WINEDLLOVERRIDES="wininet,winhttp=n,b" %command%` to the launch options.
